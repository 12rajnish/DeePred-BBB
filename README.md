# DeePred-BBB

**DeePred-BBB** is a deep Neural network-based model for prediction of blood brain barrier permeability of compounds using 
Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) notation of Compounds.

## Contents

The files contained in this repository are as follows:
 * ``DeePred-BBB_Script.py``: main script to run predictions
 * ``smiles.smi``: user input structures (multiple)
 * ``DeePredmodel.h5``: DNN prediction model
 * ``data.csv``: training dataset
 * ``PaDEL``: folder with executable for feature calculation

## Requirements

* Python
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Keras
* Tensorflow

## Usage

In order to run BBB permeability predictions with **DeePred-BBB**, save input structures as SMILES in a single 
file (e.g. ``smiles.smi``). Remember to give a name or ID to each structure.
 
1. Download this repository and ensure all the files are present in the same folder when running the script.
2. Run ``DeePred-BBB_Scrip.py``. 
  ```bash
  python DeePred-BBB_Script.py <folder>
  ```
   A csv file (``DeePred-BBB_predictions.csv``) will be created in the folder where the script is run.
   A file containing the features generated by PaDEL will be also saved to disk (``PaDEL_features.csv``).
  
> **_NOTE:_** Remember to activate the corresponding conda environment before running the script.
